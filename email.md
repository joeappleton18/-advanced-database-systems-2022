Subject: Advanced Database Systems: Welcome


Hello Database Programmers, 

Welcome to your second year and introduction to databases. 

My name is Joe Appleton; don't tell anyone, but this is my favourite module! 

The course content is now live, and I recommend (before your practical session) that you:

- Familiarise yourself with the course SOL page
- Watch the first on-demand lecture videos
- I look forward to seeing you in the practical session. 

Kind Regards,

Joe
