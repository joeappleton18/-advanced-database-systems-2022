**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 2 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Week 1 took a somewhat of a deep dive into NodeJS, MongoDB and, the rational behind NoSQL databases.

This week promises to slow things down:   

- We will be looking at how we can design interfaces to display our data. Remember, we prioritise designing data around views, not views around data.
- I am also excited to introduce to you Express which simplifies the process of processing HTML requests. 

[**Before the practical,** please ensure that you watch a short lecture video](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2022/sessions/week_2/lecture.html).

All the best,

Joe
