**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 4 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Four.

I am very excited about this week as we will be tying together everything we have learnt so far. In doing so, we are going to be exploring how we can construct **a model** layer for our application. Thus completing our MCV stack.

[Please ensure you watch the lecture before the practical](https://joeappleton18.github.io/advanced-database-systems-2022/sessions/week_4/lecture.html).

All the best,
	
Joe
