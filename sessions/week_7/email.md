**subject:** Advanced Database Systems - Week 7 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week Seven.

This week promises to address, that perhaps nagging, question:

How can we construct relationships when working with non-relational databases?

You'll learn, that non-relational does not mean no-relations, that would be very sad ðŸ˜¿. We'll also take the opportunity to look at some more advanced MongoDB queries. In doing so, we'll be able to dynamically populate the statistics on our wine tasting home page.

All the best,

Joe
