# Course Overview

Hello, and welcome to Advanced Database Systems. I am very excited about this module, as rather than look at databases in isolation; we are going to be creating a fully-functional three-tiered web application.

Along the way, we will be exploring the following technologies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Embedded JavaScript templating](https://ejs.co/#promo)
